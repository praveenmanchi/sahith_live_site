## Key Achievements:

- Spearheaded the migration project to transition the legacy Scribe application, previously relying on BC4J and PL/SQL, to a cutting-edge Spring Boot architecture for improved performance and maintainability.
- Revamped the parole management module, replacing outdated PL/SQL procedures with **Java**-backed Spring Boot services, enabling real-time tracking of parolee activities and compliance.
- Great experience working with authorization and authentication of web services using OIDC (Open ID Connect) on top of OAuth 2.0, site minder (for policy-based authentication and single sign-on), and JWT (JSON web tokens) to securely transmit information between parties as a JSON object.
- Integrated Splunk with Jenkins and other CI/CD pipeline tools for real-time monitoring of build, test, and deployment processes, increasing visibility into the development process and improving release quality.
- Good experience with automated **Java**-based logging frameworks like log4J, sl4J, log-common.
- Experience in using Kibana and Splunk for a dashboard for log data and creating charts for analysis. Proficient in implementing ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for searching and server-side data processing pipeline to ingest data from multiple sources simultaneously.
- Experience in front-end technologies like HTML5, CSS3, AJAX, Bootstrap JS, jQuery, ReactJS, web accessibility, and responsive web designs and APIs of all kinds. Used them to design and develop the presentation layer.
- Developed various single-page applications (SPA) using ANGULAR and REACT JS and used various predefined components from NPM (Node Package Manager) and Redux library.
- Worked with Angular JS (1.x) Controllers, Directives, Services, and filters for application functionality.
- Used many Angular JS-1.x directives which allow developing many custom and reusable HTML for data binding and behavior of components.
- Hands-on experience in publisher and subscriber models with queues (JMS with ActiveMQ, IBMQ). Implemented a metrics collection mechanism for the server by utilizing Apache Kafka to stream server-side events.
- Experience in developing using RESTful Web services using JAX-RS API and Jersey framework. Developed Restful services with JAX-RS with Spring REST.
