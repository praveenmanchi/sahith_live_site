## Key Achievements:

- Designed and implemented JPA entities using **Hibernate**, mapping complex business objects to **PostgreSQL** database tables for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- Utilized **Spring Boot** to rapidly develop backend services, integrating **Spring Security** to ensure robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, safeguarding sensitive financial data.
- Hands-on Experience in developing using RESTful Web services using **JAX-RS API** and **Jersey** framework. Developed Restful services with JAX-RS with **Spring REST**.
- Developed **RESTful APIs** following industry best practices, implementing **Spring Security** to secure endpoints and protect against data breaches.
- Hands-on DevOps practices by setting up **Jenkins pipelines**, and automating build, test, and deployment processes, leading to faster and more reliable releases.
- Developed single-page application using **Angular**, **TypeScript**. Worked on advanced JavaScript concepts like ES5 and ES6. Authenticated users accessing RESTful services using **OAuth 2.0**, **OID**, **OIDC** and **JWT**.
- Developed web application using **Angular 11** as front end and using **Web API** to receive and pass data to the back-end.
- Worked on Containerizing application components using **Docker**, enabling consistent deployment across environments, and simplifying development-to-production workflows.
- Implemented **Hystrix** a Latency and Fault Tolerance system for Distributed Systems.
- Implemented **Apache Cassandra** for real-time data analysis, enabling quick access to critical information and improving the overall performance of Java-based applications.
- Worked with the **OpenShift** platform in managing Docker containers and **Kubernetes** clusters. Proficient in using **SonarQube** for continuous inspection of code quality.
